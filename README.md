## Once upon a time
There was a little Dickbutt called Dicky
He was roaming the land being himself and all
When all out of sudden, all out of the blue

A giant butt tree, rushed into the planes
Full of wrath and chasing animals around
It turn toward Dicky and start running to him, furious

But then ! Dicky, valiant and brave, got into a mighty **JoJo pose** and put on the *stone mask*.
However, the tree, who hadn't any **blood**, wasn't scared of a *vampire*.

And so Dickbutt and the tree began their duel.

Dicky began to shout "MUDAMUDAMUDAMUDA".   
dicky did a lot of damage, unfortunately dicky broke his hand.  
Thus the tree win this epic battle, because of mother nature.
